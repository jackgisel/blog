# Stop Inflating Terminology

I've been having a lot of discussions with other younger engineers. A lot of the discussion revolves around high preforming young engineers & less successful ones. When speaking about what makes a less performing engineer, I feel like one attribute that often comes up is lack of confidence. I believe a large portion of this comes from industry inflated terms being thrown around. (ie: Machine Learning, "Crypto"/Cryptography, Data Lake/Warehouse/etc, Data Streaming, )

## The Truth

If you are a software engineer who studied Software Engineering the chances are you are smart enough to understand _all_ of these buzz words. Stop letting them scare you. Let's break them down to the fundamentals:

- Machine Learning: you understand recurision likely. break something into a base case and build on top it. all machine learning comes down to is this and buidling on to it
- Cryptography: you understand what a hash is. you understand how to build hashes where values can have instrinsic value. you can learn on top of this for crypto.
- Data Lake/Warehouse/etc: these are mostly marketing terms. but you know what a DB is and how some DBs offer better things. these words just define the requirements of a DB.

The list goes on. Don't let terms fool you. You understand computing & can probably reason most of the words definition. When someone asks, "Do you know what a data like is?", don't be afraid to say yes. They didn't ask if you built one.

Be confident and don't be afraid to say you know something if you can understand the primitives. If someone wanted an expert their question would be, "are you in expert in...".

Cheers.
