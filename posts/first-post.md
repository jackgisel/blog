Howdy. This blog is going to stand as a place for me to share my thoughts on new techonologies. Also I plan to build more in public and share my journey here.

### How was this blog built?

    1. This is a deno blog, deployed via Deno Deploy.

    2. Why? I think V8 isolates are pretty neat.

    3. It was fast and frictionless to start blogging with.

### What am I learning?

Right now I am debating what things to get a deeper understanding of. My current list is:

    1. AWS & it's many services

    2. Remix

    3. GoLang or Rust
