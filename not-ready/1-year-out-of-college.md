1 year ago today I started my "post-college" job. I was very fortanute to get lots of opportunities before this. Here is what my past few experiences were:

1. Interned for a boostrapped startup building a Google Docs markdown editor (like Notion, but we never went live)
2. Interned for a startup focused on enterprise solutions for advanced medical treatments
3. Freelancing for a couple e-commerece stores working in Shopify
4. Building a startup called Nexus, a digital social network based on NFC tag connections
5. Working as Full Stack Engineer on a mobile app focused on debt payoff strategies and budgetting

I consider myself very lucky for each one of these experiences. The cullmination of these experiences has made me a better engineer, stronger communicator and a well rounded employee. One common thread about all of these experiences was the size of company I worked with. I had never worked at a place with more than 60+ employees, let alone 40+ engineers. I knew that with my next gig I wanted to do something with a bigger size.

In 2020, I began looking for companies that were 100+ employees and had a strong techincal leadership behind them. High on my list were: Airbnb, Apple, Shopify, Doordash, Ezoic and Ridgeline. Fast forward through interviews and signing, I graduated in May 2021 and had signed with Ridgeline. Ridgeline, is a Dave Duffield startup focused on being the Cloud Enterprise suite for investment management.

What drew me to Ridgeline was the culture, technologies, people and the "Dave Duffield effect". I knew that great talent would gravitate towards this spot and I wanted to be sourrounded by them.

Ridgline is roughly at 300 employees accoridgy to our Linkedin. At times I often ask myself what would it be like to be a software engineer at a company like Apple or Airbnb, where there are thousands of engineers working together.
